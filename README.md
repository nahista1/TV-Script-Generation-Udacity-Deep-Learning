# TV-Script-Generation-Udacity-Deep-Learning
# RNN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

### Project Overview:
This repo contains all my work for Project 2 of Udacity's Neural Network Foundation Nanodegree Program. In this project, I have generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network I have built will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### Disclaimer:
As a CS minor student of IIT Kharagpur and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. Here I released these solutions, which are only for your reference purpose. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the solutions before you start your own adventure. This Project is almost one of the simplest Machine Learning Project I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure given by Udacity team.
